PROJECTS & HIGHLIGHTS

“Every project tells a story of restoration, precision, and partnership.”
Flysquawk Integrated Sdn Bhd, together with PT Nusantara Turbin dan Propulsi (NTP), continues to deliver cross-industry engineering solutions that merge aviation discipline with industrial reliability.

1️⃣ Strategic Aviation Asset Procurement – Boeing 747 (9M-MPD)

Client: Ministry of Defence Malaysia (MINDEF)
Project Type: Strategic Asset Recovery & Management
Partner: Malaysia Insolvency Department

Flysquawk Integrated played a pivotal role in a strategic aviation asset procurement initiative involving a Boeing 747 (registration 9M-MPD).
The aircraft, previously owned by a chartered airline, was declared bankrupt and placed under the custody of the Malaysia Insolvency Department.

Our task involved navigating complex financial, operational, and regulatory frameworks to secure the asset for national use.

🔹 Key Achievements

Full ownership transfer and asset handover to MINDEF

Resolution of financial and liability documentation

Complete coordination of logistics, relocation, and custody procedures

Aircraft repurposed into a Close Quarter Battle (CQB) Training Platform for defence operations

This project demonstrated Flysquawk’s ability to manage distressed aviation assets, combining technical expertise with strategic negotiation and government collaboration.

2️⃣ Close Quarter Battle (CQB) Project

Client: Ministry of Defence Malaysia (MINDEF)
Scope: Procurement & Asset Management

This project involved the procurement, inspection, and conversion of decommissioned aviation and defence assets into training systems for CQB (Close Quarter Battle) exercises.

Our team managed all aspects of asset selection, verification, and conversion coordination, ensuring strict compliance with defence and safety standards.

This initiative strengthened Malaysia’s defence readiness while demonstrating Flysquawk’s project versatility across aviation and industrial domains.

3️⃣ Performance Recovery – Elliot Steam Turbine (1.6 MW)

Client: Proposed for FGV Palm Oil Mill, Sungai Tengi, Selangor
Partner: PT Nusantara Turbin dan Propulsi (NTP), Indonesia
Turbine Type: Elliot Steam Turbine (1.6 MW)

This project addressed performance inefficiencies in a 1.6 MW steam turbine operating at only 550 kW (~34% of design capacity).
Flysquawk and NTP conducted a full diagnostic assessment, thermodynamic analysis, and rectification proposal to recover turbine performance and reduce energy losses.

🔹 Scope of Work

Diagnostic inspection and operating data assessment

Nozzle and expansion flow analysis

Reverse engineering study for component reconditioning

Recovery and rectification plan proposal

🔹 Key Findings

Steam flow rate: 10.4 t/h (≈170% above design)

Pressure drop profile: 20 → 11.7 → 2.5 kg/cm² (incomplete expansion)

High specific steam consumption: 18.9 kg/kWh

🔹 Expected Outcome

Restoration to ≥95% of rated capacity through nozzle and flow path refurbishment

Estimated annual savings up to RM 1 million from reduced grid and steam consumption

Strengthened plant energy efficiency and cost sustainability

This project exemplifies Flysquawk’s mission: restoring legacy equipment to peak performance — saving cost, reducing waste, and protecting capital.
